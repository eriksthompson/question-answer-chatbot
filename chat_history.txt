Context: 3, when viewed from space or when the Sun is high in the sky

The Sun is moved by the gravitational pull of the planets
 This is the time it would take the Sun to return to a stable state if the rate of energy generation in its core were suddenly changed
 With this sequence of emissions and absorptions, it takes a long time for radiation to reach the Suns surface
 Sunlight on the surface of Earth is attenuated by Earths atmosphere, so that less power arrives at the surface closer to 1,000 W/m2 in clear conditions when the Sun is near the zenith
The Sun has eight known planets orbiting it
The Sun emits light across the visible spectrum, so its color is white, with a CIE colorspace index near 0
 The direction of the Suns motion, the Solar apex, is roughly in the direction of the star Vega
3 seconds for neutrinos, which account for about 2 of the total energy production of the Sun, to reach the surface
 The Solar radiance per wavelength peaks in the green portion of the spectrum when viewed from space
 Some cultures mentally picture the Sun as yellow and some even red; the cultural reasons for this are debated
 The Sun is classed as a G2 star, meaning it is a Gtype star, with 2 indicating its surface temperature is in the second range of the G class
 The center of the Sun moves around the Solar System barycenter, within a range from 0

The solar constant is the amount of power that the Sun deposits per unit area that is directly exposed to sunlight
The Sun, taking along the whole Solar System, orbits the galaxys center of mass at an average speed of 230 km/s 828,000 km/h or 143 mi/s 514,000 mph, taking about 220250 million Earth years to complete a revolution a Galactic year, having done so about 20 times since the Suns formation
 Sunlight at the top of Earths atmosphere is composed by total energy of about 50 infrared light, 40 visible light, and 10 ultraviolet light
 Estimates of the photon travel time range between 10,000 and 170,000 years
 The Suns motion around the barycenter approximately repeats every 179 years, rotated by about 30 due primarily to the synodic period of Jupiter and Saturn
 Because energy transport in the Sun is a process that involves photons in thermodynamic equilibrium with matter, the time scale of energy transport in the Sun is longer, on the order of 30,000,000 years

The Suns gravitational field is estimated to dominate the gravitational forces of surrounding stars out to about two lightyears 125,000 AU
Question: What time does the sun set?
Answer: 10,000 and 170,000 years

Context: All natural hair colors are the result of two types of hair pigments
 They are the most chromatic, vibrant optimal colors and thus the most vibrant colors that we are able to see
 The quantity of hair hovers in a certain range depending on hair colour
 An average blonde person has 150,000 hairs, a brownhaired person has 110,000, a blackhaired person has 100,000, and a redhead has 90,000
Hair grows everywhere on the external body except for mucous membranes and glabrous skin, such as that found on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, and lips
 Eumelanin is the dominant pigment in brown hair and black hair, while pheomelanin is dominant in red hair
 Blond hair is the result of having little pigmentation in the hair strand
 Both of these pigments are melanin types, produced inside the hair follicle and packed into granules found in the fibers
 The growth rate of hair varies from individual to individual depending on their age, genetic predisposition and a number of environmental factors
 The growth rate of scalp hair somewhat depends on age hair tends to grow more slowly with age, sex, and ethnicity
 Each strand of hair on the human body is at its own stage of development

The body has different types of hair, including vellus hair and androgenic hair, each with its own type of cellular construction
 It has been estimated that humans can distinguish roughly 10 million different colors
 Scalp hair was reported to grow between 0
 So maximum chroma colors are a type of optimal colors
 Although we are, for now, unable to produce them, these are the colors that would be located in an ideal color wheel
 It is commonly stated that hair grows about 1 cm per month on average; however reality is more complex, since not all hair grows at once
 Specifically, it explains why humans cannot perceive a reddish green or yellowish blue, and it predicts the color wheel: it is the collection of colors for which at least one of the two color channels measures a value at one of its extremes

It was previously thought that Caucasian hair grew more quickly than Asian hair and that the growth rate of womens hair was faster than that of men
 The different construction gives the hair unique characteristics, serving specific purposes, mainly, warmth and protection
 Visible growth of hair on the dead body happens only because of skin drying out due to water loss
 Scalp hair was reported to grow between 0
 Gray hair occurs when melanin production decreases or stops, while poliosis is white hair and often the skin to which the hair is attached, typically in spots that never possessed melanin at all, or ceased for natural reasons, generally genetic, in the first years of life
 However, more recent research has shown that the growth rate of hair in men and women does not significantly differ and that the hair of Chinese people grew more quickly than the hair of French Caucasians and West and Central Africans

Context:  Giant planets are significantly more massive than the terrestrials: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune


Dwarf planets are gravitationally rounded, but have not cleared their orbits of other bodies
 The other eight all orbit beyond Neptune
 It soon became apparent that they were rather different from previously known planets: they shared the same general region of space, between Mars and Jupiter the asteroid belt, with sometimes overlapping orbits
 Earth is the largest terrestrial planet
According to the IAU definition, there are eight planets in the Solar System, which are in increasing distance from the Sun: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune
 The gas giants, Jupiter and Saturn, are primarily composed of hydrogen and helium and are the most massive planets in the Solar System
 They differ from the terrestrial planets in composition

The planets of the Solar System can be divided into categories based on their composition
 Saturn is one third as massive as Jupiter, at 95 Earth masses
 Thus he differentiated between the largest asteroids as true planets versus the smaller ones as collisional fragments
 Scientists generally considered planetary satellites to also be planets until about the 1920s, although this usage was not common among nonscientists
 The inferior planets Venus and Mercury and the superior planets Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn were all identified by Babylonian astronomers

In the first decade of the 19th century, four new planets were discovered: Ceres in 1801, Pallas in 1802, Juno in 1804, and Vesta in 1807
 Moreover, all of them are smaller than Mercury, with Pluto being the largest known dwarf planet and Eris being the most massive

Neptune was discovered in 1846, its position having been predicted thanks to its gravitational influence upon Uranus
 New planets were discovered every year; as a result, astronomers began tabulating the asteroids minor planets separately from the major planets and assigning them numbers instead of abstract planetary symbols, although they continued to be considered as small planets
 These would remain the only known planets until the invention of the telescope in early modern times
With the advent of the Scientific Revolution and the heliocentric model of Copernicus, Galileo, and Kepler, use of the term planet changed from something that moved around the sky relative to the fixed star to a body that orbited the Sun, directly a primary planet or indirectly a secondary or satellite planet
 All nine are similar to terrestrial planets in having a solid surface, but they are made of ice and rock rather than rock and metal
Question: What planets have rings around them?
Answer: giants, Jupiter and Saturn

 These galaxies feature a central elliptical nucleus with an extensive, faint halo of stars extending to megaparsec scales
A shell galaxy is a type of elliptical galaxy where the stars in its halo are arranged in concentric shells
 About onetenth of elliptical galaxies have a shelllike structure, which has never been observed in spiral galaxies

 Many barred spiral galaxies are active, possibly as a result of gas being channeled into the core along the arms
 Humanmade systems may have such views as concept, analysis, design, implementation, deployment, structure, behavior, input data, and output data views

The formation of these cD galaxies remains an active area of research, but the leading model is that they are the result of the mergers of smaller galaxies in the environments of dense clusters, or even those outside of clusters with random overdensities
 Humanmade systems are made with various purposes that are achieved by some action performed by or with the system
 In the Hubble classification scheme, these are designated by an SB, followed by a lowercase letter a, b or c which indicates the form of the spiral arms in the same manner as the categorization of normal spiral galaxies
 A system model is required to describe and represent all these views
A systems architecture, using one single integrated model for the description of multiple views, is a kind of system model
 These structures are thought to develop when a larger galaxy absorbs a smaller companion galaxythat as the two galaxy centers approach, they start to oscillate around a center point, and the oscillation creates gravitational ripples forming the shells of stars, similar to ripples spreading on water

Searched Wikipedia.org page - time
Context: 
In physics, time is a fundamental concept to define other quantities, such as velocity
 Traditional definitions of time involved the observation of periodic motion such as the apparent motion of the sun across the sky, the phases of the moon, and the passage of a freeswinging pendulum
 To avoid a circular definition, time in physics is operationally defined as what a clock reads, specifically a count of repeating events such as the SI second
A time standard is a specification for measuring time: assigning a number or calendar date to an instant point in time, quantifying the duration of a time interval, and establishing a chronology ordering of events
The concept of time can be complex
 In quantum mechanics, time is treated as a universal and absolute parameter, differing from general relativitys notion of independent clocks

The surface of the Earth is split into a number of time zones
 Instead, the spacetime interval is calculated and classified as either spacelike or timelike, depending on whether an observer exists that would say the events are separated by space or by time
 Standard time or civil time in a time zone deviates a fixed, round amount, usually a whole number of hours, from some form of Universal Time, usually UTC
 Universal Time UT1 is mean solar time at 0 longitude, computed from astronomical observations
 Coordinated Universal Time UTC is an atomic time scale designed to approximate Universal Time
 Most time zones are exactly one hour apart, and by convention compute their local time as an offset from UTC
 This time directionality is known as the arrow of time
 Since the time required for light to travel a specific distance is the same for all observersa fact first publicly demonstrated by the MichelsonMorley experimentall observers will consistently agree on this definition of time as a causal relation
 Terrestrial Time is a theoretical ideal scale realized by TAI

International Atomic Time TAI is the primary international time standard from which other time standards are calculated

The relationships between these different Arrows of Time is a hotly debated topic in theoretical physics
Unlike space, where an object can travel in the opposite directions and in 3 dimensions, time appears to have only one dimension and only one direction  the past lies behind, fixed and immutable, while the future lies ahead and is not necessarily fixed
 The Global Positioning System broadcasts a very precise time signal based on UTC time
 The problem of time consists of reconciling these two theories
Question: What is the time?
Answer: what a clock reads

Context: Gandhi focused his attention on Indians and Africans while he was in South Africa
 The Nobel Peace Prize winner Nelson Mandela is among admirers of Gandhis efforts to fight against racism in Africa


While in South Africa, Gandhi focused on the racial persecution of Indians before he started to focus on racism against Africans
 During Gandhis lifetime, these ideas sounded strange outside India, but they readily and deeply resonated with the culture and historic values of his people
 There, Gandhi nurtured his policy of peaceful resistance
 Gandhi entered politics by forming the Natal Indian Congress

In the years after black South Africans gained the right to vote in South Africa 1994, Gandhi was proclaimed a national hero with numerous monuments


Gandhi also campaigned hard going from one rural corner of the Indian subcontinent to another
 These ideas are evidenced in his pamphlets from the 1890s, in South Africa, where too Gandhi was popular among the Indian indentured workers
 After he returned to India, people flocked to Gandhi because he reflected their values
 Gandhi remarked that the Africans alone are the original inhabitants of the land
 Scholars cite it as an example of evidence that Gandhi at that time thought of Indians and black South Africans differently
In 2007, the United Nations General Assembly declared Gandhis birthday, 2 October, as the International Day of Nonviolence
 Gandhi cited race history and European Orientalists opinions that AngloSaxons and Indians are sprung from the same Aryan stock or rather the IndoEuropean peoples and argued that Indians should not be grouped with the Africans
 After several such incidents with Whites in South Africa, Gandhis thinking and focus changed, and he felt he must resist this and fight for rights

According to Dennis Dalton, it was Gandhis ideas that were responsible for his wide following
 In some cases, state Desai and Vahed, Gandhis behaviour was one of being a willing part of racial stereotyping and African exploitation
 Initially, Gandhi was not interested in politics, but this changed after he was discriminated against and bullied, such as by being thrown out of a train coach due to his skin colour by a white train official
 This led Gandhi to becoming disillusioned with the Empire and aroused a spiritual awakening within him; historian Arthur L
